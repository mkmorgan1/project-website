## My Personal Projects Portfolio.

I created this single-page application to showcase a couple of the most recent projects.

- I have an AWS S3 bucket and EC2 instance for storage and deployment.
- Changes in state and rendering are implemented through Redux and React.
- A PostgreSQL database stores the user's interactions with the website.
